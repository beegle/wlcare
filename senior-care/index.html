          <h2>Understanding Adult Foster Homes</h2>
          <p>An adult foster home is a licensed residential care home where a small number of seniors receive 24-hour
            personal care in a real home setting. In Oregon, adult foster homes are limited by law to a maximum of five
            residents, creating an intimate environment where each person receives individualized attention.</p>
          <p>Unlike large assisted living facilities or nursing homes, adult foster homes operate inside regular
            residential houses in neighborhood settings. Residents live much as they would in their own home, with
            private bedrooms, shared living spaces, home-cooked meals at the dining table, and caregivers who know them
            personally.</p>
          <p>For families searching for senior care that feels less like a facility and more like home, adult foster homes
            offer a deeply personal alternative.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
          <h2>How Adult Foster Homes Work in Oregon</h2>

          <h3>Licensing and Oversight</h3>
          <p>Every adult foster home in Oregon must be licensed by the Oregon Department of Human Services (DHS). Homes
            undergo regular inspections and must meet state standards for safety, staffing, and quality of care.
            Caregivers are required to complete training in areas such as medication administration, first aid, dementia
            care, and resident rights.</p>

          <h3>Daily Life</h3>
          <p>A typical day in an adult foster home revolves around each resident's preferences. Mornings might begin with
            a home-cooked breakfast at the dining table, followed by activities tailored to individual interests—puzzles,
            gardening, music, crafts, or simply enjoying conversation. Meals are prepared fresh in the home kitchen,
            often incorporating residents' favorite dishes. Evenings are relaxed, with time for reading, watching TV
            together, or quiet reflection in a private room.</p>

          <h3>Staffing and Caregivers</h3>
          <p>One of the defining features of adult foster homes is caregiver consistency. Because the home is small,
            residents interact with the same caregivers every day. These caregivers learn each person's routines,
            preferences, health needs, and personality. This continuity builds trust and allows caregivers to notice
            subtle changes in a resident's health or mood—something that's much harder in larger facilities with
            rotating staff.</p>

          <h3>Services Provided</h3>
          <p>Adult foster homes typically provide a comprehensive range of care services, including medication
            management, assistance with daily activities such as bathing and dressing, housekeeping and laundry,
            nutritious meals, and social engagement. The level of care is tailored to each resident's needs and can
            adjust over time as those needs change.</p>

            <h3>Small by Design</h3>
            <p>With a maximum of five residents, each person receives far more one-on-one attention than in facilities

            <h3>True Home Setting</h3>
            <p>Residents live in a real house in a residential neighborhood—with a living room, kitchen, dining area, and
              yard—not an institutional building.</p>

            <p>The same caregivers are present every day, building meaningful relationships and providing care that
              reflects each resident's unique needs.</p>

            <div class="feature-icon family-icon"></div>
            <h3>Personalized Routines</h3>
            <p>Daily schedules adapt to each resident rather than the other way around. Meals, activities, and rest
              happen on each person's terms.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
          <h2>Who Is an Adult Foster Home Right For?</h2>
          <p>Adult foster homes are well suited for seniors who:</p>
          <ul class="benefits-list">
            <li>Need daily assistance with personal care, medication, or mobility but do not require hospital-level
              medical care</li>
            <li>Prefer a quiet, home-like environment over the bustle of a large facility</li>
            <li>Thrive with consistent routines and familiar caregivers</li>
            <li>Are living with memory loss or early-stage dementia and benefit from a calm, structured setting</li>
            <li>Value home-cooked meals, personal attention, and a sense of belonging</li>
            <li>Want to maintain as much independence as possible while having support nearby</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Many families choose adult foster homes when they want their loved one to feel truly at home—not like a
            patient in a facility.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
          <h2>What to Look for When Choosing an Adult Foster Home</h2>
          <p>Choosing the right home is one of the most important decisions your family will make. Here are some things
            to consider:</p>

          <h3>Visit in Person</h3>
          <p>Nothing replaces seeing a home firsthand. Pay attention to cleanliness, how residents interact with
            caregivers, and whether the atmosphere feels warm and welcoming. Trust your instincts—the home should feel
            like a place where your loved one would be comfortable.</p>

          <h3>Ask About Licensing and Training</h3>
          <p>Confirm that the home is licensed by Oregon DHS and ask about caregiver qualifications. Trained, experienced
            caregivers make a significant difference in the quality of care.</p>

          <h3>Understand the Daily Routine</h3>
          <p>Ask how a typical day is structured. A good foster home adapts its schedule to residents rather than
            enforcing rigid institutional routines.</p>

          <h3>Discuss Care Needs and Flexibility</h3>
          <p>Talk openly about your loved one's current care needs and how those might change over time. The best homes
            adjust their care as residents' needs evolve, so your loved one doesn't have to move again.</p>

          <h3>Meet the Caregivers</h3>
          <p>The people providing daily care are the heart of any foster home. Take time to meet them, ask about their
            experience, and see how they interact with current residents.</p>
