### Section Title
What is an Adult Foster Home?

### Main Description
An adult foster home is a residential care option that provides 24-hour care in a real home environment. Unlike large assisted living facilities, adult foster homes are limited to just five residents, ensuring personalized attention and a true sense of family.

### Key Differences from Larger Facilities

#### Intimate Setting
With only five residents per home, each person receives individualized care and attention that simply isn't possible in larger facilities.

#### True Home Environment
Our homes are real residential houses in a quiet neighborhood—not institutional buildings. Residents enjoy home-cooked meals, comfortable furnishings, and a peaceful atmosphere.

#### Consistent Caregivers
Residents see the same familiar faces each day, building meaningful relationships with their caregivers rather than rotating staff.

#### Family Atmosphere
We create a family-like environment where residents feel valued, respected, and truly at home.

### Benefits Summary
- Personalized, one-on-one attention
- Home-cooked meals tailored to preferences
- Quiet, peaceful residential neighborhood
- Strong bonds with caregivers and fellow residents
- Flexible routines that respect individual needs
- More affordable than many larger facilities
